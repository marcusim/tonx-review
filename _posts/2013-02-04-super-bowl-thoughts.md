### What a Game.

![Great Game](http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/zoFoozOPI6ydAGUvPW1FkQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00OTE7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/172ba96a3a5f8404280f6a706700d986.jpg "AP Photos")

Besides a terribly painful blackout, this year's Super Bowl was an incredible event. Of course, as a Ravens and 49ers fan, it was by far the best Super Bowl for me personally, but even the half-time performance ([Beyonce](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-super-bowl/0ap2000000135280/Beyonce-Super-Bowl-XLVII-halftime-performance)) was better than anything I can remember (Madonna? Black-Eyed Peas? Janet Jackson?).

About the game as a whole, it actually panned out like [I thought it would](http://ma.rcus.im/football/2013/01/31/super-bowl-predictions/) - just a bit closer. The Ravens were able to *slow down* Kaepernick enough to win the game on Joe Flacco's arm. The 49ers secondary was no match for Flacco, and his legendary-streak continued. The only thing that hasn't happened yet is the 49ers winning next year's Super Bowl - and who will doubt they can do it?

Here are some thoughts from each of my fan-halves:

### Thoughts from a Ravens Fan

1. **What a way for Ray to walk away from the game.** I don't agree with him about God being invested in the game like [Buffalo Wild Wings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIVtwjdfb2M), but seriously, how could you have written it any better? Like they said on broadcast, for the game to end on a defensive goal-line stand is something you wouldn't have believed, if scripted.
2. **I'm so glad Ed Reed (my favorite player, all time) finally got his** -especially in his home-state of Louisiana. Watching him celebrate yesterday was as rewarding as anything I've watched as a fan. Voyeuristic, much? Perhaps, but his unadulterated jubilation was well-deserved. Reminds me a lot of [Dirk](http://www.thefastertimes.com/sportschat/files/2011/06/112882-dirk-nowitzki.jpeg) & Jason Kidd, when they finally won theirs.
3. **Jacoby Jones deserved the Super Bowl MVP Award.** There has been a lot of hype around the Cam Cameron firing, but the arguably best personnel move of the 2012 season is the signing of Jacoby. First of all, even as good as David Reed was as a returner, Jacoby is on a whole other level. Secondly, he finally provided a deep threat opposite Torrey. Third, Denver Broncos and Super Bowl. He came to play on the biggest stages, and who knows if the Ravens would be champions without him. And of course, [his dances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDN9zPWwEXs).
4. **But so did Joe Flacco.** Joe has been absolutely godly (or [$&#$% awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLhGFvGTwNQ)?) during the 2012 postseason. Since Caldwell took over as Offensive Coordinator, Flacco has a 15:1 TD:INT ratio, of which 11:0 happened in the playoffs. 11:0. Only 2 other quarterbacks in NFL *history* have thrown for that many TDs in the playoffs: Kurt Warner and Joe Montana. The only 2 to do that and not throw an interception? Joe Montana and Joe Flacco. As inconsistent as he's been, he earned the fat-ass contract coming his way... The only question is, will he continue to earn it, or will the up-and-down Joe come back to rear his (literally and figuratively) ugly head?
5. **Second half-time almost cost Ravens the game.** I believe this whole-heartedly. The *only* team to benefit from the blackout was the 49ers. Momentum, as qualitative as it is, is a huge part of the game of football. A team with momentum plays purposeful, enthusiastic football, and every single ounce of momentum in the Super Dome was on the Ravens' side. To come out of half-time with the momentum and take it to the next level with a KR-TD and big defensive sack only separated the divide that already existed between the two teams. The blackout allowed the 49ers to recover and cooled the Ravens' jets. Terrible thing to happen in the biggest American sports event.
6. **Bernard Pierce might be better than Ray Rice.** What?! Okay, okay... Pierce isn't better than Rice at this exact moment, but he's better than Ray Rice was as a rookie. If Pierce was given a starting role, there's no doubt he'd be a star. He drives his feet with purpose, makes sharp 1-cut explosions, and can make people miss when he needs to. People refer to him as the "cheap-man's Adrian Peterson", and if you watch him run, you can see why. Is it just coincidence Pierce and Peterson both averaged 6 yards per carry? This situation will be interesting to watch unfold... I hope we don't end up losing one of the two, like what happened with Jamal Lewis and Priest Holmes back in the day (though it's definitely not a bad problem to have).
7. **John Harbaugh is an idiot.** The fake-FG was the wrong call. Obviously, this is easier for me to claim since it wasn't successful, but either way, it was the wrong call. Sure, Justin Tucker is more athletic than probably any kicker in the NFL, and the field position would have pinned the 49ers deep even if it failed, but that's no reason to throw away 3 points. I admire the courage of John Harbaugh to make that call, choosing to go for the jugular, but he needed to save that play for a 4th-and-3 situation, not 4th-and-9. Asking Tucker to make a 9 yard run conversion against a FG-package that includes Patrick Willis is just silly.
8. **John Harbaugh is a genius.** Besides the great calls by Dean Pees on the final goal-line stand, the greatest coaching moment of the game was on the fake-punt safety. When you watch the film, Harbaugh told his team to blatantly hold the defenders during the fake punt. Why? Because even if the holding is called in the end-zone, the worst that can happen is a safety. The time would still be drained off the clock and the outcome would have been what the Ravens wanted, regardless. Seems like a loophole in the rule book (like Giants & Patriots), but great awareness on John's part. This move was one of those plays where you semi-jokingly say, "They should do *this*" - even when you know they won't. Except they did.

### Thoughts from a 49ers Fan

1. **Colin Kaepernick is the real deal.** Like I said in the [other post](http://ma.rcus.im/football/2013/01/31/super-bowl-predictions/), Kaepernick is pretty much what we all thought Cam Newton would become - and that's really scary. He's huge, fast, and has a rocket for an arm. I'm convinced there are throws in certain situations that only *he* can make and he already owns the record for most rushing yards by a QB in a playoff game. And the best part? He's only 25. While that's pretty ancient when you're referring to your friends (happy birthday, Jeff), for a Super Bowl NFL QB, that's basically newborn. We're going to have a lot of time to watch Kaepernick, and if that doesn't get you pumped for the future, you're not a fan.
2. **Culliver didn't deserve to be there.** Chris Culliver was torched over and over - again. From the jump-balls with Boldin to the long-bomb to Jacoby Jones, he was often left on the short end of the stick. Now, to be fair, Culliver isn't the only one to blame - the entire secondary was weak in coverage - and he should've had an offensive PI, but Culliver definitely made quite a case for a secondary overhaul during the offseason. And it certainly didn't help his case when he made the [dumbest comments of Super Bowl week](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/chris-culliver-undergo-sensitivity-training-crisis-youth-anti-192113920--nfl.html) (and that's even with Randy saying his own share of [crazy](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/randy-moss-proclaims-himself-greatest-receiver-time-171543456--nfl.html)).
3. **The no-call wasn't *that* bad.** We all agree, there was contact on the 4th down that decided the game. The referees were blowing calls all game, but this one drew more attention because it was the last real play. At the end of games, referees just don't want to make the game-deciding call ([except GB v. SEA LOL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HInIZ4CdVOw)). Let's not forget Navorro Bowman got away with some contact against Roddy White in the NFC Championship game. We shouldn't have to rely on a call to win - and plus, the worst non-call was [Cary Williams *shoving* a ref](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu4cu10-rhk).
4. **Second half-time didn't mean much.** As true as it might be that this extra break slowed the momentum of the Ravens, that's still no excuse for what happened in the 3rd quarter. The 49ers dominated like we're all used to watching: with decisive offense, biting off chunks in the run game, and with game-changing defense and special teams. It's not the 49ers' fault the Ravens came out flat from the extra break.
5. **Michael Crabtree is legit, but who else?** Crabtree was a disappointment for a couple years after getting drafted in the first round, but there's no doubt he's finally come into his own. He started turning it on in the playoffs last year, and it carried over for the entire 2012 season - with both Alex Smith and Kaepernick. He's an integral part of the young 49ers' future, but he won't be able to do it himself. Sure, Vernon Davis is a beast, but we all know that already, and he's not going to draw the extra attention away from Crabtree. Let's hope Trent Baalke can find someone to help Crabtree.
6. **Jim Harbaugh is the best coach in the NFL.** [John Harbaugh agrees](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-player-interviews/0ap2000000135769/John-Harbaugh-I-think-Jim-is-the-best-coach-in-the-NFL). The turn-around since he's been in has been outstanding (though he had some help from the terribleness of HC Singletary). The offensive creativity of Jim has been on display all year, and the [counter-run play in the 3rd quarter](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000135467/Gore-6-yard-TD-run), where Frank Gore ran in untouched, was the culmination. He fooled everybody on the Ravens defense (not an easy task), except for Ed Reed, who was met by a pulling LG and TE. Unbelievable play-design and execution. You know Jim's having a ton of fun with his new toy, Kaepernick.

### About that Blackout

Couldn't resist adding a couple more things on the blackout:

1. **I seriously wonder whether or not the blackout was some sort of jab at Roger Goodell from New Orleans.** I can't think of any man that the people of Louisiana hate more than Goodell after the suspensions, and for the NFL to be made a fool during the biggest TV audience of every year, it had to feel good for some folks in NO.
2. **Jim Harbaugh is the brother that...** un-plugs the Nintendo when he's losing. I forget who came up with this joke, and obviously it didn't actually happen, but the image of a fully-grown Jim Harbaugh un-plugging the Nintendo is actually not that hard to imagine.
3. **Speaking of Buffalo Wild Wings,** [this commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CEhPd8c8Yo) just became a *lot* more interesting. Conspiracy theories, anyone?
