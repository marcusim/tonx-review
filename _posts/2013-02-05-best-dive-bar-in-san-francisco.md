### is Zeitgeist.

![yum.](http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qFa13249ax6n8OgtIk_wfQ/l.jpg 'Thirsty...')

It really comes down, pretty much, to [Zeitgeist](http://www.zeitgeistsf.com/) or [Toronado](http://www.toronado.com/). They both have amazing beer selections (mmm [Russian River](http://russianriverbrewing.com/)), so why Zeitgeist?

Simple, really:

1. **Dat Bloody Mary.** Tasty, spicy, and strong. Just like how I like my women.
2. **Porch.** Lots of space and outdoor seating - neither of which Toronado can claim to have. If you smoke, you can accelerate your demise on the sweet community-style benches!
3. **Zeitgeist Matchbooks.** If you haven't seen one yet, you can thank me later.

One word of warning: Beware the hipsters.
