### is Zeitgeist.

![yum.](http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qFa13249ax6n8OgtIk_wfQ/l.jpg 'Thirsty...')

When it comes to delicious beers and sticky floors, it really only comes down to [Zeitgeist](http://www.zeitgeistsf.com/) or [Toronado](http://www.toronado.com/). They both have amazing craft beer selections (mmm, [Russian River](http://russianriverbrewing.com/)), so why Zeitgeist?

Simple, really:

1. **Dat Bloody Mary.** Tasty, spicy, and strong. Just like how I like my women.
2. **Big Porch.** Lots of space and outdoor seating - neither of which Toronado can claim. If you smoke, you can accelerate your demise *while* pounding beers on these sweet community-style benches!
3. **The Tamale Lady.** Please tell me you've at least [heard of her](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-tamale-lady-san-francisco). This is her stomping ground. Also, I'm not exactly sure what's in her sauce bottles, but get it.
4. **Zeitgeist Matchbooks.** If you haven't seen one yet, you can thank me later.

One word of warning: Beware the hipsters.
