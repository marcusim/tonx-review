### Ravens: 31 - 49ers: 24

This game is really only going to come down to one thing. And it's definitely not this guy:

To be fair, the reason why Chris Culliver won't matter in the end isn't just his depressing homo-phobia: His unit, the 49ers defense, will be torched by Joe Flacco.

lolwut?

Don't get me wrong. If you asked me about the 49ers defense during the regular season, I would've gone on-and-on about the superiority of Aldon Smith, Justin Smith, Patrick Willis, Ahmad Brooks, Navorro Bowman... you get the picture. They're completely stacked. I don't mean any disrespect on this group. But this isn't about them.

### It's about Joe.

It wasn't always like this, though. As a fervent Ravens fan, I can tell you Joe has been [aggressively average](http://www.nfl.com/videos/baltimore-ravens/0ap2000000112713/Broncos-defense-INT-TD) - or maybe inconsistent is a better word. Really, regardless of the adjective, nobody - not even the most-optimistic of fans - could've seen Joe's late-season transformation coming.

Perhaps it was the shift along the Ravens' offensive line, bringing the [mountainous McKinnie](http://jocksandstilettojill.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bryant-mckinnie-lil-kim-natalie-nunn-e1303835668623.jpg) back in at tackle, that spurred Flacco on. That's definitely a worthy argument and, without a doubt, a large (get it?) factor, but the single greatest factor was also the best move of the 2012 season: firing Cam Cameron for Jim Caldwell.

I never felt like the criticism Cam Cameron received during his tenure in Baltimore was always fair, but there's no denying the difference Jim Caldwell brought to the table. Joe's games under Caldwell have been incredible. His QB-Rating is through the roof and his TD:TO ratio has been *literally* legendary (Steve Young & Joe Montana). And the teams he played against? The Giants, Colts, Broncos, and Patriots. Those aren't cake-walks. As a matter of fact, I'm still convinced the Broncos were the best team in the entire playoff field (sorry Lisa & Robben, my most-loyal Broncos fan friends).

And yet, as weird as it is to say something like this, given the Super Bowl is on the Superdome turf, I don't see any defense slowing down the Ravens offense - even the vaunted 49ers'.

So then, what does this game come down to?

### The Ravens Defense v. Colin Kaepernick.

Will the Ravens D be able to slow down the Pistol offense? Can Ray Lewis keep up with Kaepernick turning the corner? Will Kaepernick have the tenacity and strength to trade blows with the hard-hitting Ravens defense?

This is going to be *the* on Sunday. The Ravens defense has looked mortal throughout the 2012 season, but after entering the playoffs, they've been stellar. The fact that they were able to keep Tom Brady's top-ranked offense to 13 points speaks volumes... but shouting right back has been the performances of Kaepernick. He's been incredible. He's become what we all hoped Cam Newton would bloom into - and that's scary.

If I had to guess, the under-rated (so strange to describe it as such) Ravens defense will be able to *slow* Kaepernick and grab a couple turnovers. That will be the deciding factor in this game. How sweet would it be if Ray Lewis sealed the game with an interception?

Ray Lewis will do his best Jerome Bettis-impersonation and ride off into the sunset with another ring. And Ed Reed will claim his own as his career winds down. The 49ers will win it next year.
