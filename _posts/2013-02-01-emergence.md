### Snowflake Teams

What are snowflakes?

I honestly have no clue. I didn't pay enough attention in school to remember anything about them. But I do know this: they're basically fancy-ass frozen rain-drops.

...and great examples of [emergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence). Whereas molecules of water are typically not all that fascinating on their own, when they come together and decide to get cold, they become a magical little snowflake.

They're also great examples of how teams should be created. A successful team must be greater than the sum of its parts - and though that's no easy task, luckily for us, we don't need a PhD in snowflakogoly to glean a couple lessons.

### Come Together

When the time comes to build a team, as basic as it sounds, you need to be able to find the parts. But not just any part, they need to be *special* water molecules.

Surround yourself with talented people so you have a network to tap into when you're ready for the dance. I think most companies understand this point, though that doesn't mean they're good at it.

### Get Cold

But it's not enough to just put together an extremely talented team. And this is where teams (almost) always trip-up. You need to get cold.

Basically, you need to have a team unified around one vision and one direction. That doesn't mean your team needs to be a bunch of yes-men who would never disagree; it means your team needs to see a singular goal and work well together to get there. "Where are we going?" Everybody should have the same answer.

### Rain

Imagine if a group of extremely-talented water molecules decided it was time to get together, but a portion of the molecules decided they wanted to get hot instead of cold. What would happen? You'd get a boring drop of rain. A boring, lukewarm drop of rain that probably falls on someone's wedding - ruining the entire day, fueling [Alanis Morissette's ego](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_(song)), and providing a metaphorical omen of the couple's now-inevitable doom.

I've only been out of college for 4 years now, but I've had the pleasure (curse?) of working with over 10 different teams. A handful of those teams understood what it meant to "get cold," but the majority of companies fail to recognize this crucial step. They swim up-stream through rivers of mediocrity, and what eventually starts to happen is every snowflake's worst nightmare: the water-molecules get bored and start to... *evaporate* (become apathetic and walk away, not die).

All over-extended metaphors aside, companies will live and die based on this principle.

Sure, it's an accomplishment in itself to get a team of talented people together, but in order to reach the next level, that team needs to be groomed and nurtured to achieve something greater than themselves. That's emergence.
