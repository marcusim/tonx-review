### Seriously.

I don't mean to use superlatives this often (or do I?), but as a die-hard Ravens fan and by-default 49ers fan, I can't help but declare the 2012 NFL season as the best ever.

2011 was close, but it decided to shove a huge middle-finger in my face during the Conference Championships. Lee Evans, anybody? Cundiff? Kyle Williams?

Too soon.
